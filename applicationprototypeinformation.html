	<h1>About The List of Lists</h1>
		<p>The List of Lists was created from my own problems of saving notes, lists, and reminders in different places across different devices. From PCâ€™s OneNote and Notepad to 
		saved text documents on my phone. I wanted a location where you could compile theses miscellaneously spread-out documents and thus, I strived to create the App List of 
		Lists. The List of Lists was coded in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Minimal Hardware Requirements to run the website are Windows OS, Dual Core Processor, and 4 GB RAM.</p>
