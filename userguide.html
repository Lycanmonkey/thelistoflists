		<p>The List of Lists will open in your preferred internet browser (such as internet explorer, Chrome, etc.). once open, you will be directed to a screen with buttons and 
		multiple text boxes. To start, impute your email address into the box at the top left of the screen. Simply copy any text from your saved documents on your phone 
		or PC and paste them inside. To add more boxes to expand your lists, simply click “add boxes” at the top of the screen. If you would like to remove some boxes, you may click 
		"Delete Boxes" to remove any additions to your list. Clicking the Email button will send the documents as an email to the user allowing them to access their compiled lists while on 
		the go or at home. The website is a work in progress, not all features are available.</p>
